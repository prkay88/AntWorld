     * than the traditional hashing function. It is more similar to a

     * if you resend the same object, only a pointer to the object is 
     * sent across the network. This is very clever, and saves network 
     * bandwidth. However, the ObjectOutputStream cannot detect 
     * whether your object was changed internally, resulting in the 
     * Receiver just seeing the same object over and over again. 
     * You will notice that this was quite fast. We sent 1'500'000 
     * objects in 19548ms (on my machine). (well, we only sent one 
     * object, and 1'499'999 pointers to that object).
