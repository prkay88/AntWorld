# AntWorld
In groups of 2, write a client that connects to the Ant World server and intelligently manages an ant colony.

For grades of D, C, B, and A, you need to lose to, tie, beat or definitely beat the an unknown, instructor written AI of moderate smarts.

Winning is defined as the score calculated from the total food your team has brought to the nest and your nest's ant population.


To COMPILE:
I did not include the .idea configure file since some of the setting are platform specific.
After you create an IntelliJ project with the repo source, you will need to go into Project Structure and set
Modules -> Sources ->
   Content Root: yourpath\AntWorld
   Source Folders: src
   Resource Folders: resources

Modules -> Dependencies -> 
   1.8 (java)
   <Module source>
   
   
To RUN:
First, start the server:
   antworld.server.AntWorld.main(String[] args)
   
When the server is ready for a client it will display in the console:
Server: socket opened on port 12321
Server: waiting for client connection.....

Then, start your client. To get started, you can use the sample client:
  antworld.client.ClientRandomWalk.main(String[] args)

  If args is null or length < 1, then the client will try to connect on localhost.
  Otherwise, args[0] will be used as the hostname.
